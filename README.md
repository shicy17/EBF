[Google drive: BUAA_Campus Denoising Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NiswzR7yJ9z_nxOyc7dXW76b0hXZdViz?usp=sharing). For academic use only. This dataset is a part of our article "Event-Based Bilateral Filter for Effective Neuromorphic Vision Sensor Denoising". 

The dataset was captured using an iPhone and transformed into event sequences with a resolution of $346\times260$ through the v2e method. This transformation ensures that the event sequences are free from noise. The dataset comprises two sequences recorded on the campus of Beihang University. During these recordings, the photographer was seated on an electric bike, incorporating significant camera movements to enhance the dynamic capture of the scene. The scenes themselves are richly textured and bustling with dynamic objects such as pedestrians and vehicles, posing significant challenges for denoising tasks.

For a fari comparison, we provide the original event sequences and sequences with noise at level of 1Hz/pixel, 3Hz/pixel and 5Hz/pixel, respectively.
